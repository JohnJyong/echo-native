# EchoNative (原生回响) 🗣️✨

> **Your AI Voice Mirror. Speak with confidence, in your own voice, but perfect.**

EchoNative is an AI-powered language learning application that acts as a real-time "voice mirror." It allows users to speak in a target language (starting with English) and immediately hear themselves repeated back with **perfect native accent** and **grammar**, while retaining their unique **voice timbre (Timbre)**.

## 🌟 Core Value Prop
**"听见完美的自己" (Hear your perfect self)**
Build confidence by providing immediate, positive auditory feedback. It's not just about correcting errors; it's about helping users *believe* they can sound like a native speaker.
